Collaboration on higher-order relationships, geometry, information, etc.

* This Github is for e.g. sympy or algorithm code & maybe the yaml for that Ellis+John info-sharing app
* [This Dropbox Paper doc]() (think collab latex) is for math notes

When you need a motivation:  How can we detect market-inefficiency using irreducible rank-3 info?

Rank-3 info is (for a choice of info-compression fcn `I`):

  `I(x,y,z) < min{ I(i,j) + I(j,k) - I(j) }` for any arrangement of `i,j,k` over `x,y,z`
